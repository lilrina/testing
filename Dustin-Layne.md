I worked on issue #18 from https://github.com/gzdwsu/RaiderPlanner/issues/18  

This issue was an issue from a previous semester that was still open. It can be found here:

After playing with this, I realized the issue seemed to be fixed except that the milestones table was way too large compared to the others. However, every time I changed anything, nothing changed. Including my commits. The only time commits worked are when I created a file through the browser. I changed multiple table sizes, column sizes, row sizes, by making them absurdly large. This resulted in 0 changes to the actual table.

Commits I did that I have proof of are:
